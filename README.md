# Quién vale más?
 
This is a game I play with my girlfriends. 
I get  a pair of celebrities and I get my friend to choose the ones she desires more and why… I have made it into an app.

STACK: Python, Flask, Sqlalchemy, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jinja2

In this app, the user plays by creating a list of celebrities, and sends it to a friend to play by choosing from the list pair by pair until she chooses the one she likes more. 

Create list and send to your friends to play.

You can see who your friend has chosen from the list you send it.

You can receive games from your friends and play as well.
